# The Precision Pulse

**AI for Personalized Epilepsy Treatment**  
*High-Tech Entrepreneurship Project ‚Äì Politecnico di Milano (AY 2023/2024)*

## Overview

The Precision Pulse is a health-tech innovation project focused on improving epilepsy treatment using machine learning. It aims to assist neurologists in selecting the most effective treatment by leveraging historical patient data. By reducing trial-and-error in drug prescription, the platform supports better outcomes, faster clinical decisions, and lower healthcare costs.

This project was developed as part of the High-Tech Entrepreneurship course at Politecnico di Milano and was presented to a panel of investors and medical experts.

## Problem Statement

Over 50% of epilepsy patients do not respond to the first assigned treatment, resulting in unnecessary delays, costs, and frustration. The goal of this project is to support neurologists with an AI-powered platform that suggests optimal treatment paths based on prior clinical outcomes and patient profiles.

## Solution

An AI-driven decision support tool that:
- Predicts treatment efficacy based on patient data
- Provides tailored treatment recommendations
- Integrates into clinical workflows via an intuitive UI

---

## Project Scope

### Research & Validation
- Interviews conducted with 3 practicing neurologists in Italy and Portugal
- Market analysis, user profiling, and early validation of product-market fit
- Data privacy and compliance consultation with Startup Legal (GDPR and MDR)

### Technical Focus
- Exploratory ML model design (prototype phase)
- Data-driven approach relying on structured patient records
- Analysis of EEG, clinical test results, and treatment outcomes

### Strategic Work
- **Business Model Canvas** and **Value Proposition Canvas**  
- **SWOT Analysis**: Positioned for niche leadership in treatment recommendation  
- **Roadmap**: From pilot to market launch (Q2 2024‚ÄìQ2 2025)
